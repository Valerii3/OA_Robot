# OA_Robot
This script creates a map with user size and then randomly place the robot and obstacles, after that it displays the map using `matplotlib` and print the coordinates of closest obstacles to the robot.

# How to run:

1) Via **PyCharm**
* Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Valerii3/OA_Robot.git`
* Open the directory in PyCharm and run `main.py`

2) Via **Docker** (in this case to see the map you should open the `output` directory because docker does not support Gui
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose run -it python-app`
